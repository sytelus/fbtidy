FBTidy
============

The basic idea for this web app is to classify news fed stories in to buckets so people with little time can easily chose to ignore all those cat videos. The entire web app is Javascript based that directly makes call to Facebook Graph APIs and renders UI without pretty much any server side activity. Current prototype is fully function but still a features I wanted are pending.
