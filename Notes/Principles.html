    <h1>Core Architecture and Design Principles</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Never alter or delete original source transaction files</li>
        <li>We should always be able to re-construct all outputs at any time</li>
        <li>Never alter source transaction information</li>
        <li>All changes in transaction are always created as edits, saved in seperate files</li>
        <li>User edits are kept seperately and can be applied on top of any transactions or shared with other users</li>
        <li>Most edits should be in form of rules</li>
    </ul>
